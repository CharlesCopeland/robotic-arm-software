# Robotic-Arm-Software
I started developing this software, roughly, Fall of 2016 to provide a method to control my friend's robotic hand. Our project, the development of an intelligent and dextrous robotic arm, is a year into development, with many iterations througout the models and code. This project started as a simple open and close function and has developed into a precise method to mimic the user's finger movements (angle of bend) and wrist orientation.

## Robotic/Prosthetic Hand Models
The robotic/prosthetic hand 3-D modeled and designed from scratch, by my friend, Ryan Gross:
